## Migration Steps

Follow these steps to migrate your Spring Boot project from version 2.7.X to 3.X:

1. **Update Spring Boot Version:**

      ```xml
      <parent>
          <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
          <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
          <version>3.0.0</version>
          <relativePath/>
      </parent>
      ```
